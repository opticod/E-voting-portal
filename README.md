# E-voting-portal
This project was especially designed for IITP, Gymkhana Elections that use to happen in our college yearly for different student representative
posts. This was my first project in very first year of my undergraduate course.

## Why we need such a platform?
Currently the procedure of Gymkhana Election is: we have to cast our votes by going to a place, filling up a form
and then dropping it into a box. One/two weeks later results use to be declared. The Process is bit lengthy and
requires lot of physical labour and consumes time.
Hence, this idea came to me to develop a system, which can be easily accessible from anywhere inside and
outside the campus using a smart-phone or a computer device.
This will simplify our life a lot saving our time and our effort.
